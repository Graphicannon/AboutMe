    <h2>Head of Graphic Design & Advertising for Cardiacs Sports & Memoribilia</h2>

    <p>I am an Eagle Scout and currently a student at Wake Tech Community College earning my Associate of Applied
      Science in Advertising and Graphic Design. Above all I am Christian and I put my faith above everything else. I
      currently work for my father's small business "CARDIACS Sports & Memorabilia". It is a sports card hobby shop
      where I am an associate and also head of graphic design, social media, and advertising. I love working for my
      father but I would like to start a career in the advertising and graphic design field soon. I love to design
      anything from banners and posters to car wraps and product packaging. I will graduate from Wake Tech with 5
      certificates along with my AAS degree.

      When I am not working I am usually with my fiance managing my eBay account where I make extra money selling
      baseball cards. You can usually find me with a Mello Yello in my hand or at least near by.

      I like to try new things and meet new people who love design as much as I do.</p>
